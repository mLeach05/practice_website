    <p>Hello! I am currently a third year student at Northeastern University majoring in Data Science. I hope to pursue a career in Data science where I can meaningfully contribute to people's lives and leave a positive impact. I have taken numerous courses in programming and mathematics, as well as business courses to help me contextualize data in a business framework. Some of these courses include machine learning, where I learned about different machine learning models, their applications, and how they were used, as well as international business, where I learned about the different approaches and challenges that come with expanding a business into new markets. 
My previous work experience, while not related to my degree, has taught me a lot. I have worked at a sushi restaurant, where I learned how to adapt to new systems and processes quickly, as well as making sure that the back of the restaurant was compliant with health and safety guidelines. I also gained leadership experience, as I trained two new employees before I left. During my time working at five guys, I learned how to be successful in a fast-paced environment, honed my customer service skills, and built better tools to resolve conflicts.
