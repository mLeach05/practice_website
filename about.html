    <h3>Personal Interest</h3>
    <p>Welcome to this about me page, where you can learn a bit more about what i do outside of classes! Iâ€™m involved with a few clubs on campus, including ELITE HEAT, a club that meets biweekly to train/work out, and sponsors entrance into spartan races (excited for the one coming up this next weekend!). Outside of class and clubs, I usually send a lot of time with my friends, whether it be just walking around the city or playing games with them online. I like to travel, and am fortunate to have spent a semester in London where I got to be more immersed in what other places have to offer! I have also been to Italy and Canada, as well as Hawaii.
