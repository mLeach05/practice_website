    <h3>Personal Interest</h3>
    <p>Welcome to this about me page, where you can learn a bit more about what I do outside of classes! Iâ€™m involved with a few clubs on campus, including ELITE HEAT, a club that meets biweekly to train/work out, and sponsors entrance into Spartan races (excited for the one coming up this next weekend!). Outside of class and clubs, I usually spend a lot of time with my friends, whether it be just walking around the city or playing games with them online. I like to travel, and am fortunate to have spent a semester in London where I got to be more immersed in what other places have to offer! I have also been to Italy and Canada, as well as Hawaii.
    <br>Having grown up in the PNW I also enjoy spending time outdoors, whether it be long camping trips or just daily excursions. Some of my favorite outdoor activities include biking (on trails or otherwise), skiing, (I've tried snowboarding but it hasn't typically gone well), and hiking. I hope to get up to the mountain to ski more this year, and may try my hand at snowboarding again. I also spend a lot of time listening to music, and am looking at getting back into playing guitar.
